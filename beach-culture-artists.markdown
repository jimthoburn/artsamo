    Born in Canada to Chinese-Jamaican immigrant parents and raised in Texas, Wally Rudolph settled in Los Angeles after a peripatetic youth. He is a multidisciplinary artist and diversity advocate whose debut novel, Four Corners (Counterpoint/Soft Skull, 2014), garnered praise for its unflinching prose and drew comparisons to the hard-edged but compassionate work of Denis Johnson, among others. His second novel Mighty, Mighty, was published to critical praise in 2015.
