Artist Residencies
------------------

Residency programs promote a diverse variety of artistic endeavors in Santa Monica, provide fresh interpretations of this "city like no other," and open avenues of discourse between artists and their and their communities. Santa Monica strives to cultivate not only local artists, but also artists from other areas. Our Artist Residency programs help to welcome other artists, and therefore other experiences and perspectives. We offer many types of residencies at both the Annenberg Community Beach House and the Camera Obscura Art Lab.

Santa Monica Cultural Affairs invites local, regional, national and international artists/teams to submit qualifications for a prequalified artists roster. The Artist Roster, a curated shortlist of artists, will enable us to connect amazing qualified artists to projects and opportunities in Santa Monica. Cultural Affairs believes artwork is labor, and will ensure that funding is allocated in project budgets to pay artists for their time. All entities using the Santa Monica Cultura Affairs' prequalified roster will be strongly encouraged to budget artists' fees when planning potential projects.
