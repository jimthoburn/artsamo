You will never regret taking time out of your busy day to go see art. Santa Monica offers a rich collection of public art, self-produced art and more. Get out there, drink it in and let it refresh your soul. You can’t see it all, of course. But you can try.

Art makes the day better. And we're dedicated to integrating as much art as possible into our community’s daily life. We encourage you to notice it as you go about your day, and invite you to seek it out in areas you don't normally visit. Press a marker on the map below to get a peek at the public artworks in Santa Monica. To see more, visit the [Public Art Archive](http://www.publicartarchive.org/santamonica)!
