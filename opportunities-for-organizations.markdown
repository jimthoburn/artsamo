<small>Grants</small> for Organizations
===============================

To ensure a robust arts and culture ecosystem for both residents and visitors to the City, Cultural Affairs offers five grant programs for Santa Monica-based arts and heritage nonprofits.

### Organizational Support Program (OSP)

Deadline
: March 18, 2019

Applications will be available
: February 2019

Instructions & previous year’s guidelines
: [OSP Grant Guidelines](https://www.smgov.net/uploadedFiles/Portals/Culture/Grants/Organization_Support_Grant_Program/Guidelines%20OSP%202019-21%20final.pdf)

General operating support grants are vital to a thriving cultural scene. Santa Monica’s Organizational Support Program (OSP) was created in 1996 to provide multiyear support to the City’s nonprofit cultural institutions. This robust program makes grants of up to ten percent of local organizations’ budgets. Grants are awarded after an application process, currently on a two-year cycle.

Resident organizations are defined as those whose primary administrative office and primary location of programming (more than 50%) are within Santa Monica city limits. Organizations receiving grants will:

*   Increase world-class artistic production and exhibition in Santa Monica
*   Offer opportunities for creativity, artistic participation and greater understanding of cultural heritage to diverse members of the community
*   Promote high standards of organizational management
*   Position the City as an international creative center
*   Open avenues of discourse to broad topics of human creativity and learning among the general public

### Community Access & Participation (CAP)

Deadline
: May 21, 2019 by 5:00 p.m. (Pacific Time)

Santa Monica’s Community Access & Participation (CAP) program provides grants of up to $7,000 to nonprofit arts organizations for cultural programs in all media with the goal of providing increased access to the arts and culture to Santa Monica residents and visitors. All projects must take place in Santa Monica. Applicants are encouraged to consider city parks such as Tongva and Reed Parks as potential venues, as well as City-owned facilities such as the Miles Memorial Playhouse. 

[Applications for FY2019-20](https://smcad.gosmart.org/) are now available and are accessed online via the GO Smart system. To fill out an application, navigate to "Current Programs & Applications" and choose "Community Access & Participation 2019-20." Applicants new to the system must begin by creating a profile.

All applicants must read the [CAP 2019-20 Program Guidelines](https://www.smgov.net/uploadedFiles/Portals/Culture/Grants/CAP_Grant_Program/CAP%20Guidelines%202019-20%20final.pdf) before completing an application. Budget instructions for the application may be downloaded [here](https://www.smgov.net/uploadedFiles/Portals/Culture/Grants/CAP_Grant_Program/Budget%20Instructions%20-%20CAP.doc) and are also available in the application itself.

Required informational sessions will be held at the Ken Edwards Center on Wednesday, May 1, 2019 at 7:00pm and on Saturday May 4th at 11:00 am. Applicants who have not received a CAP grant in the past three years must attend one of the CAP informational sessions. All applicants, however, are strongly encouraged to attend. Call 310.458.8350 or email [nathan.birnbaum@smgov.net](mailto:nathan.birnbaum@smgov.net) to reserve a place for one of the sessions. The Ken Edwards Center is located at 1527 Fourth Street between Colorado and Broadway, in downtown Santa Monica. Attendees who park under the Ken Edwards Center will have their parking validated.

CAP grant applications are accepted in three categories. Please read the program guidelines for a complete description. The three categories are:

#### Community Access & Participation

This program supports Santa Monica-based arts and cultural agencies in the presentation of exemplary cultural opportunities. Applicants should demonstrate a history of high-quality work, professional management practices and an ability to serve diverse communities.

#### Latino Community Access & Participation

The Latino CAP grants support to programs that preserve and stimulate Santa Monica's rich Latino heritage. This grant is not restricted to arts organizations. Any Santa Monica-based nonprofit agency serving the community is eligible to apply in this category. Qualifying organizations must demonstrate professional management standards and serve Santa Monica's Latino population by employing professional artists in high-quality cultural programs.

#### Building the Future

This category is designed to engage Santa Monica youth in activities that encourage a lifelong association with the arts. Programs must take place in non-classroom settings and adhere to the California's Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) standards. Qualifying agencies must demonstrate professional management standards and a history of education programs of outstanding value.


### Arts Transportation Grant 

There’s no deadline for applications, but we suggest you apply by mid-November 2018 to ensure funds are available.

Applications available: Annually in September in the week after Labor Day.

How might one person’s life change by being exposed to the arts? Applying for a grant that reimburses you for transportation costs can make it possible.

The City of Santa Monica Arts Transportation Grant Program provides access to arts and culture activities throughout Los Angeles County. Any Santa Monica school or nonprofit organization who wants to take their group to visit a cultural destination in L.A. County may apply for reimbursement of transportation costs. Trips must take place between **October 1, 2017 and June 7, 2018.** 

Support for this program comes from the Metropolitan Transit Authority’s Proposition A Local Return funds.

### Strategic Sustainability Initiative (SSI)

Deadline

Applications available

The purpose of the City of Santa Monica’s Strategic Sustainability Initiative (SSI) is to invest in the medium-to-long term sustainability of the City’s core cultural agencies. The program makes grants of up to $20,000 available to current OSP grantees for one-time strategic initiatives.
