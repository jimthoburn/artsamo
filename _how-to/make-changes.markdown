# How to make changes

As you make changes and save them on GitHub, the [website](https://beta-artsamo.digitalservice.la) will automatically update.

The website content is written in a language called _Markdown_. You can learn enough _Markdown_ to begin making changes, after about three minutes of reading the [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) guide.

The first step is to find the page you want to make changes to.

1. Open the [pages folder](https://github.com/jimthoburn/artsamo/tree/master/pages) .

2. Select the page you’d like to edit. The pages are named the same as their URL on the website. For example, you’ll find the content for the [/beach-culture/](https://beta-artsamo.digitalservice.la/beach-culture/) page in a file named [beach-culture.markdown](https://github.com/jimthoburn/artsamo/blob/master/pages/beach-culture.markdown).

3. Press the `edit` button.

4. Change the text to your liking. _Hint, you can press the “preview” tab to see how your changes will look._

4. Press the `Commit changes` button. _You can optionally write a description of your changes that will be added to the project history._

Your changes should appear on the website within a few minutes.
