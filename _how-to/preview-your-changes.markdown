# How to see a preview of your changes

If you’d like to see how your changes will look on the website before making them public, you can work in the [staging branch](https://github.com/jimthoburn/artsamo/tree/staging)–a copy of the website files, that’s published at https://staging-artsamo.digitalservice.la

You can make edits in the staging branch and commit them just as you would normally. They’ll automatically appear on the staging website within a few minutes.

Once you’re happy with how your changes look on the staging website, you can copy them over to the [public website](https://beta-artsamo.digitalservice.la) (the `master` branch) using a pull request. Here are the steps:

1. Press the “new pull request” button.

https://github.com/jimthoburn/artsamo/pull/new/staging

2. Write a title for your pull request (this is optional).

3. Press the “create pull request” button.

4. And then, press the “merge pull request” button.

5. And lastly, press the “confirm merge” button.
