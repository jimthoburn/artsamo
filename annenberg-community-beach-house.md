    <div class="image"><img src="/uploads/wally-rudolph.png" height="300" alt="" /></div>
    
    January 16, 2019 – March 20, 2019
    
    Born in Canada to Chinese-Jamaican immigrant parents and raised in Texas, Wally Rudolph settled in Los Angeles after a peripatetic youth. He is a multidisciplinary artist and diversity advocate whose debut novel, Four Corners (Counterpoint/Soft Skull, 2014), garnered praise for its unflinching prose and drew comparisons to the hard-edged but compassionate work of Denis Johnson, among others. His second novel Mighty, Mighty, was published to critical praise in 2015.

    <div class="image"><img src="/uploads/art-division.png" height="200" alt="" /></div>
    
    September 9, 2019 - January 5, 2020

    The unbroken horizon between ocean and sky is one of the most iconic images of Los Angeles. For those of us born and raised in California, the horizon is part of our everyday life, we may take for granted as just another beautiful view in our home city. For the thousands of immigrants who have come to Los Angeles over generations, the horizon over the Pacific Ocean is a symbol of hope, freedom, and the promise of new life.
